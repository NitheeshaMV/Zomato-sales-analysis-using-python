 # Zomato Sales Analysis

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes **Zomato sales data** to derive meaningful insights into restaurant types, sales trends, pricing distribution, and correlations between different features. The dataset undergoes **data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization** using Python.

## ðŸ“Š Dataset Description
The dataset is sourced from **Zomato sales records** and contains the following columns:
| Column Name      | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `date`          | Date of the transaction |
| `restaurant_type` | Type of restaurant |
| `sales`         | Total sales amount |
| `rating`        | Customer rating |
| `city`          | City where the restaurant is located |
| `cost_for_two`  | Average cost for two people |

## ðŸ›  Data Preprocessing
- Removed **duplicates** and **missing values**
- Converted `date` column to **datetime format**
- Standardized numerical values

## ðŸ“ˆ Exploratory Data Analysis
### ðŸ“Œ Restaurant Type Distribution
- Count plot to visualize the **number of restaurants by type**.

### ðŸ“Œ Sales Trend Over Time
- Line graph to analyze **sales fluctuations over time**.

### ðŸ“Œ Rating Distribution
